# Linear regression with one variable 

- Linear regresison with one variable, means that we will have a single feature (input) $x$.
- Also is named univariate linear regression.

Recall how linear regression works:

1. Starts with a training set that incluides features *x* and outputs targets *y*.
2. The learning algorithm produces a function *f* (on machine learning named hypothesis)
3. Function $f$ makes an estimation or a prediction $\hat{y}$, named $y$ hat (we say $\hat{y}$ is the prediction of $y$).

> $x$ -> $f$ -> $\hat{y}$
> 
> $x$ = feature (input)
>
> $f$ = model 
>
> $\hat y$ = prediction of $y$ (estimated $y$) (output of the model $f$)
>
> $y$ = target

IMPORTANT: 
- $\hat y$ is not the target $y$. (E.g. If we want to know the price of a house. That price is $y$, but we cannot know with acuraccy the real price $y$, only and estimation $\hat y$.)
