# Supervised learning

- Algorithms that learn x (input) -> y (output label) mappings.
- You provide examples to learn from, which includes the right answer (y) for an x input.
- Each input is labeled
- Goal: **Predict a *y* result from an unseen *x*.**

## Types of learning algorithms

There are two tipes:
### Regression
Predict a number from infinitely possible outputs.

**Examples:** 
- Predict the price of a house based on the house size in feet. 
- Predict the salary of an employee based on the experience year the employee has.

### Classification

Predicts a **category** from a small finite number of possible outputs. 

- A category is not allways a number.

**Example:**

Predict if a tumor is malignant or benigm based on the size of the tumor

We can have more than two categories.

We can have more than one input value (x).

For this the program needs to calculate a **boundary line** to separate classifications.
