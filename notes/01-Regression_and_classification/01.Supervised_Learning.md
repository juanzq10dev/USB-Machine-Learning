# Supervised learning

- Algorithms that learn x (input) -> y (output label) mappings.
- You provide examples to learn from, which includes the right answer (y) for an x input.
- Each input is labeled
- Goal: **Predict a *y* result from an unseen *x*.**

### Types of learning algorithms

There are two tipes:
#### Regression
Predict a number from infinitely possible outputs.

#### Classification

Predicts a **category** from a small number of possible outputs. 

- A category is not allways a number.
