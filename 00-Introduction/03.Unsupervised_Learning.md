# Unsupervised learning

- Unsupervised learning == Super supervised learning.
- Data comes with inputs *x*, but not output labels *y*.
- Goal: Find some structure or some patterns.
- We do not supervise algorithm to provide a right answer. 
- We want the algorith to figure out by itself some patterns or structures might be.

## Clustering
- Classify non labeled data in groups named clusters.
- Each group or cluster have common patterns or are somehow related.

**Application example:**

Google news. Groups related news together.
- Recommends news based on the cluster. 
- The algorithm knows by itself what to recommend. (no person intervenes)
- No one provides the algorithm with an example of type "Panda". (Data is not labeled).

## Anomaly detections.
- Used to detect unusual events.
- Find unusual data points. 

## Dimensionality reduction 
- Compress data using fewer number
